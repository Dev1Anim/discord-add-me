# Template - Discord themed introduction profile.
This is a template of an Introduction site i made myself with Discord in mind.

It uses the almost identical css assets from the site, and it's made so you only have to edit the information inside and use it at your own will!

This is a static site with no php behind (but will thought how to add in the future) so you don't have to worry, you can easily implement it with GitHub pages, your personal nginx server or your prefered hosting service!
